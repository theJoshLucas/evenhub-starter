# Test Run: Multi-container startup page

- test_id: startup-multi-container

- result: not-sure
- answer: not-sure
- startup_created: true

## Goal
Confirm two separate text blocks appear together on startup.

## Expected on glasses
- Block A @ 2026-02-14T16:46:38.354Z
- Block B @ 2026-02-14T16:47:39.007Z
- Expected layout: Block A then Block B, with no intentionally blank spacer lines between them.

## Notes
This is what I see in my glasses:

`
Block A @ 2026-02-14T16:46:38.354Z



Block B @ 2026-02-14T16:47:39.007Z
`

I’m not sure if there are actual line breaks or if that’s just how the glasses display two separate containers (if there’s default padding present or something).
