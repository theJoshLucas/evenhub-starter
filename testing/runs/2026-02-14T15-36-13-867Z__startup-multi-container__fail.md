# Test Run: Multi-container startup page

- test_id: startup-multi-container
- run_at: 2026-02-14T15:35:05.837Z
- result: fail
- answer: no
- startup_created: false

## Goal
Confirm two separate text blocks appear together on startup.

## Expected on glasses
- Block A @ 2026-02-14T15:34:58.394Z
- Block B @ 2026-02-14T15:35:03.827Z

## Notes
I still see the text from the previous test “Offset text” in my glasses. It was not replaced by the new test’s expected output.
