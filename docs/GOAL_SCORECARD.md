# North Star

- “Ship a useful Conversate replacement behavior on G2 via Even SDK.”

# This week’s non-negotiables (max 3)

- Mic input works.
- STT roundtrip works.
- One recap card renders.

Run update (commit):
- What moved the Conversate goal forward: Added this scorecard so each successful commit can stay focused on measurable progress.
- What didn’t: No product behavior changed yet; this commit only added planning structure.
- Next single highest-leverage test: Verify mic capture starts, records, and returns non-empty audio data in one end-to-end browser check.

# Stop doing

- Cosmetic UI polish unless it unblocks a listed non-negotiable.
